# What is this?
This is a prank script created for fun. You can modify it to your needs, but please keep it non malicious.
This is tested in Mai 2022 and works with IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.2 (Ultimate Edition) but should work on other IntelliJ versions. But you might have to tweak the code a little bit.
If you need to tweak. Go through the steps in this script and change them when you see it runs into problems.

# How to use
Before using this script. I assume that you know how to encode with DuckyToolkit and the basics around this.
https://ducktoolkit.com/encode#

1. Change the file location for output file. You can also change the name and filetype.
2. Tweak the delays if needed. If it is a slower computer, take them up couple of hundres or thousands. But do not make them faster. IntelliJ needs time to load.
3. Have fun <3

Check the breakdown if you want a deeper dive into how it all works.
